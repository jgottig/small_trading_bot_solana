
# Solana Swap by Solana Tracker

How does it work?

The bot monitors the Telegram Calls group of your choice. Once inside, every time a buy alert is sent in the group for a specific coin, the bot retrieves its Market Cap and contract address. If both meet the established conditions, the purchase is executed automatically.

Then, the bot continues to monitor the coinâ€™s price, using different percentage thresholds based on the current price to decide whether to sell or hold. If the Market Cap increases, the bot automatically updates the sell range (floor price).

If the Market Cap drops below the sell floor (Stop Loss), the bot executes the sell order automatically and continues monitoring.
